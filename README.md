# CodeNotes

My code snippet project. Mostly created for my continued PHP learning. 

Definitely not ready for any sort of production use. Use at your own risk.

It's built on:

* Web pages, CSS and a tiny bit of Javascript.
* PHP for some page automation, file saving / reading / deleteing.
* Apache 2 web server, running locally on my dev PC only.

Not yet worked on:

* Any kind of security to protect the server from bad inputs.
* Incorporating the Tags into the filter (search) function.
* A warning before a file is deleted from the server.
* Some kind of container for easier installation.

With this you can:

* Save snippets of code or any other text to a file on the web server.
* Add a file from your workstation instead of pasting the text in manually.
* Get them back quickly by filtering the list of all saved text.
* Double-click in the "Code" field to highlight all of the text.
* Press Ctrl-C (or whatever you use) to copy the text from the "Code" field for use elsewhere.
* Delete an existing file. 
    * Warning! There's no confirmation for that - it's just deleted, and there's no undo.

Feel free to copy whatever you need from here -- but remember it's a student's hacking, not a finished project or meant to be seen as good for others to reference.
